# Exploratory-Data-analysis-for-bike-sharing-rides-data

This code is about exploratory data analysis of bike sharing rides data along with the correlation of weather data.
the data is from october to december. it is shown from the analysis that number of daily rides decreses significantly as the weather gets cold. Also a lot of insightful analysis are performed in the jupyter notebook.

I have also included the data files if anyone interested to do further analysis.
